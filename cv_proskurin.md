### ACS Team manager in [BL Group](http://www.bl-g.ru/en/about/history/) [project department](http://www.svetoservis.ru/) (Jan 2008 - May 2015)

#### Main projects
 - The development of the [architectural illumination](http://www.svetoservis.ru/index.php/inwork/kreml) of the Moscow Kremlin

 - Participating as a project department rep in creation of Integrated Automated System For Architectural Lighting (IASAL). IASAL was created to connect all the urban installations of architectural lighting in a single network. Control is exercised from the control center. Monitored electrical characteristics and lighting modes. I developed a control system of the installation level and the dispatching software for storage and distributed loading of light shows to installations.

 - Development and implementation of interactive colour-dynamic [lighting system](http://www.svetoservis.ru/images/stories/projects_2012/zol_ostr.jpg) for "Golden island" (Moscow). The system reacted to the movement of people and started different color programs. A special light panel was created and we make it to work under our control system.

 - Development of a distributed control system (with the possibility of  preloading of colour-dynamic programs) for [colour-dynamic illumination](https://youtu.be/Xx3HWaGvAfc) of facade of the new stage of the Mariinsky theatre in St. Petersburg. Key features: the system can work with low speed, unstable communication channel (PLC in this case) because the color program is distributed to fixtures in the daytime.

 - The leadership of the program for the development of an annual set of media content for festive and daily modes of operation on the main Moscow streets, including media facades on New Arbat Street. It was big job starting from developing videos and color dynamic shows for eight hight buildings on the New Arbat Street street and finishing with hundreds of buildings on the main city highways. We developed content for 23 festive modes, which were supposed to be synchronously started at a given time
